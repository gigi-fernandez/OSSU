Assertions in python basically check if a condition is true, and if false it raises an AssertionError and stops the flow of the program.

Assertions should be used for checking the following:

- Type
- Value
- Constraints on return values
- Some things I don't yet understand

Its syntax is:
```
assert [condition], ['error message']
```
