Parallel lines always have the same slope:
$f(x) = mx + n$
$g(x) = mx + p$
$f(x)\parallel g(x)$

Perpendicular lines' slope is always the negative inverse of the slope of the other line
$f(x) = mx + n$
$g(x) = \frac{1}{-m}x + p$
$f(x) \perp g(x)$

Length of a line made from two points is the square root of the sum of the square of its distance:
$A (Ax, Ay)$
$B (Bx, By)$
$|AB| = \sqrt{(Bx-Ax)^2 + (By-Ay)^2}$
