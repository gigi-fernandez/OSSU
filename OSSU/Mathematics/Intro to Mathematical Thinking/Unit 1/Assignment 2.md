1 ^ 2
(b) 7 <= p < 12 `p is between 7 (inclusive) and 12 (exclusive)`
(c) 5 < x < 7  `x is between 5 (exclusive) and 7 (exclusive)`
(d) x < 4 `x is smaller than 4`
(e) -3 < y < 3 `y is smaller than 3`
(f) x = 0 `x is equal to 0`

The answer is the same for both. If I'm able to find the result of the conjunction, I will also know the result of ($\neg$ conjungtion), as they are opposites:
- I would try to find a $\phi$ that is false. If I can find one, it means that the conjunction is false, otherwise, it is true.

The answer is the same for both. If I'm able to find the result of the conjunction, I will also know the result of ($\neg$ conjungtion), as they are opposites:
- I would try to verify that a single $\phi$ is true. If so, the conjunction is True. Otherwise, it is false.
