I shall prove or disprove the statement A(m, n) by finding an example. Take A(0, 0):
	0 + 0 + 0 is a perfect square.
Therefore there are integers m and n for A(m, n) to be a perfect square (0$^2$)

I shall try to find a positive example:
	$\forall$m $\exists$ n (mn + 1 = q^2), q being an integer.
	m is an arbitrary positive integer

A(1) $\wedge$ A(n) => A(n+1)
	m * 1 + 1 = q^2
	m + 1 = q ^ 2?
	False, take m = 1
	1 + 1 = q^2
	2 = q ^ 2
	q cannot be an integer.

# WRONG
