When magic became apparent and abundant, it was during a time of peace in the region of Yabral Tariq, a very important strait for geopolitics and commerce. This region, ruled by a centuries old council of sailors, had been ruled under the same hands despite being separated by sea thanks to the naval expertise of its conquerors. 
The two plots of land of the region were adjacent to very different cultures, and even religion, and so, with the centuries, they had grown culturally diverse, although increasingly divided. Guadaus and Damalsca, north and south.
They had opened the region to people from very different backgrounds, given their commercial nature, and exercised freedom of belief (a rare occurrence).

Three decades after the Advent of Ether, the civilization of the northern lands has been facing existential dangers for almost half a century. Poor leadership, famine and disease ravaged the north, with Radargenta, the Silver citadel, being the last bastion of their civilization that hadn't devolved into chaos. 
At the time of the events of the game, Radargenta, desperate for help, seeks aid from Yabral Tariq to help cure the plague and provide supplies to their kingdom, in exchange for future compensation. 

Guadaus, having closer ties with the north and having less of a military focus, proposes to listen their call, but Damalsca refuses, citing old grudges (?)
