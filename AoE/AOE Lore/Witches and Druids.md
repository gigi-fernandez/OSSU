# Witches and Druids

Witches and druids are practitioners of nature magic, drawing their power from the natural world around them. While they share some similarities, there are distinct differences between the two.

[AI Design]: To differentiate witches and druids in gameplay, consider implementing unique skill trees or spell lists for each. Witches could specialize in potion-making and curse-based spells, while druids focus on shapeshifting and elemental manipulation. This would give players distinct playstyles and strategic options when choosing between these classes.

[AI Worldbuilding]: In the world of Advent of Ether, witches and druids could have a complex relationship. While both revere nature, their approaches might differ. Witches might be seen as more pragmatic, willing to bend nature to their will for the greater good, while druids take a more preservationist stance. This could lead to interesting conflicts and alliances in different regions of the world.

## Witches

Witches are often solitary practitioners, living on the outskirts of society. They are known for their skill in herbalism, potion-making, and divination.

[AI Design]: Implement a potion-crafting system unique to witches. Allow players to gather ingredients from the world and experiment with different combinations to create powerful elixirs. This could be a key gameplay mechanic that sets witches apart from other magic users.

[AI Worldbuilding]: In some regions, witches might be feared and persecuted, while in others they are respected healers and advisors. Consider creating a "Witch's Covenant" - a secret society of witches that shares knowledge and protects its members, adding depth to the witch's role in society.

## Druids

Druids are guardians of nature, often living in harmony with the wilderness. They have the ability to communicate with plants and animals, and can call upon the elements for aid.

[AI Design]: For druids, create a shapeshifting mechanic that allows players to transform into different animals, each with unique abilities. This could be used for exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving, making the druid class versatile and engaging to play.

[AI Worldbuilding]: Establish sacred groves throughout the world - places of great natural power where druids gather to perform rituals and commune with nature spirits. These could serve as important locations for quests and story events, as well as hubs for druid players to learn new skills and receive missions.

[AI Design]: To further distinguish between witches and druids, implement a faction system where players' actions and choices align them more closely with one group or the other. This could unlock unique abilities, quests, and story content based on their affiliation.

[AI Worldbuilding]: Consider creating a major conflict in the world's history involving witches and druids. Perhaps a great calamity occurred when a group of witches attempted to harness a natural force that the druids believed should remain untouched. The aftermath of this event could still be felt in the current timeline, influencing how these groups are perceived and how they interact with each other and the wider world.
