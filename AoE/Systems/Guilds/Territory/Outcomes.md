This is a list of undesirable outcomes:

- Monopoly/Oligopoly: Few guilds dominating indefinitely the same zones effortlessly. Resource hoarding makes it impossible to contest.
- Atomization: Small guerrilla guilds making it impossible for any guild to control territory for long periods of time. Too fragmented.
- Turtling: Defending is so much easier than attacking that the best tactic is to just be passive and defend with minimal resources.
- Raid: Attacking is so much more advantageous that there is no point in trying to defend. Best strategy ids to go full viking and just pillage.

Desirable:

- Risk reward balancing: defending territory gets non-linearly harder the bigger it gets. Costs of maintenance, hiring units, risks of shipments getting robbed, etc.
Defending a few territories is easy and manageable.
Attacking the big guilds territorial outskirts is easier
