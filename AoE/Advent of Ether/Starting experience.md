Players can choose one of multiple starting experiences:



These experiences should include a tutorial scenario where characters experience something similar to what they will play as later on. A merchant starting experience will focus on gathering, trade, taking loans, etc, while a mercenary starting experience will put them in a battle for territory with some NPCs.

Tutorials should be mini-3-acts
