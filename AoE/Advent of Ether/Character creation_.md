Many of these rely on the ability to communicate between gluexml and server.

Creating a character is divided between different sections (which you can select on a panel on the right hand border). 

First section is ethnicity. There are no races, only human, but from different backgrounds. Dwarves may be included as a type of human. A brief description is provided below the choices (picture two rows, few columns, and under is the description and a picture of the place of origin). An info button reveals that races have no effect on how you play besides where you start and some NPC interactions.

Second section is appearance customization. Ideally, each race should have a skinny and bulky option beyond the normal one.

Third section is class. Few rows and columns, and below is the description. On top of everything you can find an info button that explains that class choice is flexible and can be changed afterwards, as well as that it's possible to have multiple classes at once.

Fourth section is origin. This gives the option of starting your character a special way. For example, with the Wanderer origin, you start wherever you want with some supplies and an extra bag. With the Soldier origin you start with a green weapon of your choice. This has no gameplay effect beyond what is listed.
Same as with classes, there are a few rows and columns, with a description underneath and an info button explaining what the section means.

Fifth section is an optional one, class customization. It allows you to change which abilities you start with from all bundles of lvl 1 abilities for your class. For example, for a Warrior you can choose the Duelist bundle, the Dreadnaught bundle, etc... Also, if you want, you can gain a disadvantage in exchange for a feat at lvl 1. You can always revert this change later in the game, losing the disadvantage and the feat. 
Ex: Opium Adict: You need opium every 4h to function, otherwise you become Withered, reducing your stats by 15%. 
Ex: Accursed: Choose a Curse. This will forever affect you.
