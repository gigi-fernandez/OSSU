Guilds can build buildings in their nodes by using resources. There are a few categories, depending on their purpose:
- node developing: oriented to make the node extract more resources and have more functionalities. 
- node defense: self-explanatory. Walls, watchtowers, garrisons, etc
- node expansion: oriented to make it easier to siege neighbor nodes.
