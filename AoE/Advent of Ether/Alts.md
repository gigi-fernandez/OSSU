Make alt leveling and gearing less tedious/repetitive. Some suggestions:


- Players should be able to opt-out of these things. When creating an alt, they should be able to choose between these options or to start from scratch.
- Alts start at the maximum level of the account.
- Skill learning/discovery is tied to the account, not the character. So whenever you discover something, all alts do so too. Instead of having to do the questline again, do all the grind, whatever, alts just have to invest points in it to unlock it.
- Soulbound gear is account-bound instead. You can trade any items with your characters.
