Guilds can contribute more players if they have the units necessary for them to command. Each player commands up to 4 units.

Each guild can contribute 40 commanders (players) (can be reduced on launch when there aren't as many active players). Each commander can have 4 units under their control, which makes it 160 units per team (so a max of 320 units, 80 commanders = 400 entities)
