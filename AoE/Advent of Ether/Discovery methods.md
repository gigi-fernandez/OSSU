There are a few discovering methods for abilities:

1. A chance to discover abilities after slaying a unit that uses something similar.
2. If the unit is elite or rare, discovering the spell after slaying it is guaranteed.
3. Finishing quests. 
4. Participating in events.
5. Being taught by a mentor (an accredited RP player dedicated to being a master).
6. (Highly experimental) Research: Some abilities are not discovered until the realm invests enough resources into researching them. This is a collective effort.

Those discovered abilities are represented by loot with the name of the ability. Those 'items' are consumed on pickup (you discover the ability) and are only lootable by one person, meaning the loot is not shared.

Some abilities are 'looted' by many mobs, such as general school theme abilities (fireball, lightning bolt, strike...).

Some specific ways to discover abilities:

*Discovery by NPCs*
The classic 'discover dragon breath after slaying elite dragon'.
Bestow Power (Trick) is discovered after slaying a support creature that uses that same spell on other enemy units.
Echo of Steel is discovered from a enemy unit that uses that very spell on themselves.
Defy Death is discovered from a phoenix Elite. It must be a hard fight as it is a really good and crucial spell.
Warping Tempo: Discovered after defeating a time related elite or rare.
Aftershock is discovered in an electric themed area, after defeating one of many enemies.
Nevermend: Is discovered after defeating an elite witch which was preventing some innocent people from healing from an illness.


*Discovery by Quests*
Blazecast is discovered in a timed quest (Destruction) where you have to slay a lot of scattered and clumped Riftlings. These are generally very frail, but some require stronger spells and not just AoE. 
Innocuous Malediction is discovered through a quest given by a priest of some kind who wants to protect people form curses.
