# Guild Nemesis System

1. Guild-based Nemesis System:
   - Instead of individual orcs, have rival guilds or factions that grow in power and influence.
   - These rival guilds could have a hierarchy of NPCs, with leaders and lieutenants that players can interact with or fight.

2. Dynamic Relationships:
   - As guilds engage in trade, conquest, or diplomacy, their relationships with other factions change dynamically.
   - Positive interactions could lead to alliances, while negative ones could create nemeses.

3. Procedurally Generated NPCs:
   - Create a system that generates unique NPCs for each rival guild, complete with names, appearances, and personalities.
   - These NPCs could have strengths, weaknesses, and traits that affect their behavior and abilities.

4. Memory and Grudges:
   - Have the system remember significant interactions between players and NPCs.
   - NPCs could hold grudges against specific players or entire guilds based on past encounters.

5. Power Struggles:
   - Implement internal power struggles within rival guilds, where defeating one leader might cause another to rise up.
   - Players could potentially influence these power struggles through their actions.

6. Adaptive AI:
   - Have rival guilds learn from their encounters with players, adapting their strategies and defenses over time.
   - This could make repeated conflicts more challenging and interesting.

7. Reputation System:
   - Implement a reputation system where player actions affect how they're perceived by different factions.
   - This could influence trade deals, diplomatic options, and the likelihood of conflict.

8. Unique Rewards:
   - Defeating nemesis NPCs or rival guilds could yield unique rewards, such as special items, abilities, or territory.

9. Story Generation:
   - Use the nemesis system to generate unique storylines and quests for each guild.
   - This could create a more personalized and dynamic narrative experience.

10. Faction-specific Abilities:
    - Give rival factions unique abilities or units based on their theme or specialization.
    - This could add variety to encounters and encourage different strategies.

11. Nemesis Raids:
    - Create special raid encounters against powerful nemesis factions, requiring coordination among guild members.

12. Diplomatic Options:
    - Allow for non-violent resolutions to conflicts, such as negotiation, bribery, or intimidation.

Implementing these ideas would create a rich, dynamic system that adds depth to guild interactions and creates unique, memorable experiences for players. It would encourage long-term engagement and strategy, as players navigate complex relationships with rival factions.

A player may have multiple nemeses, and each nemesis may have multiple allies. This creates a complex web of relationships that can be influenced by player actions, collaboration, or betrayal.

Most nemeses are supposed to be eliminated easily, so that players can progress in the game without being bogged down by a single, insurmountable enemy. A player is supposed to defeat multiple nemeses throughout the game, only through failure and difficulty ramp up should a single nemesis become insurmountable. But that's also how players are encouraged to band together, to form guilds, to help each other fight off nemeses. The bigger the nemesis grows, the better the rewards for defeating it.

NPC guilds also compete for resources, territory, and players.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1

Player John just started playing. He has reached level 10 and is exploring the world. He decides to help the locals fight off a band of bandits. He manages to kill their leader. Unkowingly, he has just made an enemy of the bandit guild. The bandit guild will now view him as a nemesis. He must choose whether to back down, negotiate, or fight back. If he chooses to fight back, he should join a guild that can help him. The guild, however, assumes all nemesis relationships from their members. Guilds must carefully consider which nemesis they take on, and which ones break alliances.

Therefore, Guilds tend to band together from common enemies.

### Scenario 2

Player Doe is a new Artisan player, and is looking to get into the Smithing trade, given that it seems like an unexploited market. Again, unknowingly, he has made an enemy of the local Blacksmith guild, by undercutting their prices and skipping their introductory quests, which were purposefully made difficult to discourage new players. The Blacksmith guild will now view him as a nemesis. They will send thugs after him, try to sabotage his business, and generally make his life difficult.

Doe wishes not to join a guild, and he realizes what an uphill battle it is to try to fight that nemesis, so he decides to move on to another town where he will not be bothered.

However, Doe's buddy, Jake, decides to join the Blacksmith guild. The guild will now view Jake as an ally, as long as he follows the guild's rules.

In fact, there is another young Blacksmith who is fed up with the guild, so he bands together a guild of his own against it. They can now either negotiate with the Blacksmith guild, or fight them. The ultimate defeat of the Blacksmith guild will either be comercial or through combat. All of these decisions are recorded in the system, and will affect the relationship between the surviving guild and others.

When the Blacksmith guild is attacked:

1. Players in the guild receive an alert about the attack.
2. They can choose to:
   - Defend the guild (engage in combat or economic defense)
   - Remain neutral (no action, but may face consequences)
   - Defect to the attacking guild (if offered)
3. Consequences:
   - Defenders gain loyalty points if successful, lose standing if defeated
   - Neutral players may lose guild privileges or be expelled
   - Defectors gain standing in the new guild but become enemies of former guildmates
4. If the Blacksmith guild is defeated:
   - Loyal members become part of a weakened faction or are forced to disband
   - They inherit the guild's nemesis relationships, making them targets for rival guilds
5. The outcome affects each player's reputation, trade options, and future guild opportunities.

This dynamic system ensures that guild conflicts have meaningful consequences for all involved players, adding depth to the game's social and economic aspects.

### Scenario 3

Player Mike is not a member of any guild. Through careful maneuvering, he has avoided becoming anyone's nemesis. One day, he decides to stroll around the city. He accidentally upsets a warlock, who decides to become Mike's personal nemesis. This is a one-on-one relationship. Throughout the conflict, the warlock will recruit allies to help him fight Mike, will try to attack him himself from the shadows, etc. Only through killing the warlock will Mike be free from his nemesis.

### Scenario 4

Player Sarah has accidentally become the nemesis of multiple guilds. What do the consequences of this be? What if they managed to defeat her? Does that mean she is free from the nemesis? Does it ever stop? (CONSIDER THIS SCENARIO)

## Essence of the System

The essence of the system is that each player has agency over their own reputation, and that reputation can be influenced by their actions. However, they are not alone in this struggle. Other players have their own reputations, and their actions can also influence the overall landscape of reputation in the game.

As a player, you must consider the actions of others, and how your own actions can influence the reputation of your guild, and by extension, your own reputation.

As a guild leader, you must consider the actions of your members, and how their actions can influence the reputation of your guild, and by extension, your own reputation.

As a player, you must choose your actions carefully, as they will have long-lasting effects on your reputation and that of your guild.

## Diplomacy with NPC Guilds

Diplomacy with NPC guilds functions similarly to player-run guilds but with pre-programmed behaviors:

1. Reputation system: Actions affect standing with NPC guilds.
2. Negotiation options: Players can engage in dialogue, trade, or quests to improve relations.
3. Alliance/rivalry mechanics: NPC guilds form alliances or rivalries based on player actions and game events.
4. Consequences: Positive or negative relationships affect trade prices, quest availability, and territory access.
5. Dynamic responses: NPC guilds react to player choices, adapting their strategies over time.

This system ensures that interactions with NPC guilds remain engaging and impactful throughout the game.
