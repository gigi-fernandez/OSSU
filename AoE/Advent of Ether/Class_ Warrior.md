Warriors, even in a world now filled with magic, are a force to be reckoned with, now even more than ever. Since the AoE, a lot of Warriors have become fiercer and more skilled in combat. 
Warriors are present in every society, and while a lot share combat style, some types of warriors may follow another one, or innovate over the standard style. There are warriors of every social standing, but those of higher status much rather be Knighted instead.

They use Medium Armor, but can learn Heavy Armor if they choose to as a skill. They can use either heavy 2H weapons or dual wield 1H weapons (or even use a shield for some things).

Warriors do not use a resource. Instead, their mechanic is Flow of Battle and Momentum. Their attacks are divided in Light attacks (1.5 GCD) and Heavy Attacks (2.5 GCD).

Flow of Battle: Your Light Attacks reduce the global cooldown of your other warrior abilities by 0,2. Stacks up to 5 times. Lasts for 3 seconds, so you must upkeep it. Breaks upon using a Heavy Attack.

Momentum: When you reach max stacks of Flow of Battle, your next Heavy Attack will have an increased effect is guaranteed to crit. While with Momentum, the GCD of your next Heavy Attack is reduced by 1 second. When you have Momentum, your Light Attacks do not refresh the duration of Flow of Battle, and using a Heavy Attack will consume the Flow of Battle.
For example, the heavy attack Crushing Blade deals a moderate amount of damage that is multiplied when used with Momentum. Cleave hits multiple targets. Devastate Armor ignores armor, etc. 

Ability ideas:
1. Wind Up: Increases the damage of your next attack by 20%.
2. Disarm: Disarms and interrupts the target for a few seconds.
3. Parry: Channeled ability that makes you parry. Parrying decreases the damage you take by your Parry value.
4. Preventive Attacks: For the next 10 seconds, your attacks increase your Parry value by X. Stacks indefinitely. 18 second CD.
5. Defend: Increases your Parry value by 40% for 6 seconds. Breaks Flow of Battle, unless you have Momentum.
6. Berserking: Reduces your armor by X% and you can't cast Parry, but you increase your melee haste, damage and threat.
7. Warcry: Increases your nearby allies' Attack Power and reduces that of your enemies by X.

4. Revenge: Deals damage equivalent to X% of the damage you have received in the last few seconds. Can't exceed 25% of your max HP. MOMENTUM: Increases the % and max possible damage.
