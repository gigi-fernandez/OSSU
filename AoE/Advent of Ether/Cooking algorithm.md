Attributes:
https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/53/how-to-write-a-menu.html
Each ingredient has a set of weighted attributes, freshness (fresh, old and spoiled) and quality (4-scale). All ingredients have 5 versions: excellent, very good, good, normal, spoiled (automatically given poor quality).
Some attributes have counterbalances, like sour and sweet, light and heavy... When appearing on the same meal they are subtracted from each other. 
Some attributes get intensified and others get milder, depending on the time and method of cooking.


Preferences:
Assigned 1h before the character gets hungry. Disappears after eating.
Works as:
- Would like 3 attributes (high chance of favorite one appearing). Extra buff if the meal meets all 3 attributes.
- Would dislike 1 attribute + hated ones. Disliking a meal neglects the buff granted by it, but still removes hunger.
