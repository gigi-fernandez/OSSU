Incentivize delegation. 
Management should be ideally handled by multiple players, with different layers of responsibility and abstraction.

Same with siege combat. Instead of one commander deciding everything, divide units into different subgroups, divided into squads (smallest form of authority) commanded by a single person. 
The commander can still take over and retake control of a squad, reassign its leader, etc (units will follow the chain of command).

Ex: A large army has 100 units and players about to siege. The commander creates divisions with different objectives, and assigns a leader to each one. The division leader must repeat this step and create squads with specific purposes, and assign a leader to said squad. The squad leader would take control of the troops, they would follow him and respond to his requests. 
If the division leader thought a squad leader was lacking, he could assign another leader to the squad, and the squad units or players would have to obey the new squad leader.
