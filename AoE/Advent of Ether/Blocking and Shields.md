Blocking uses a hidden resource (shown when blocking) called Vigor. 

While blocking you absorb all damage taken and instead reduce your Vigor. It's a 1:1 ratio of HP|Vigor, although it can be improved. 
If your Vigor drops to 0, you become more vulnerable and unable to block for 5 seconds.

Vigor regenerates at 5% per second. (Can be a fixed + % rate).
