Each guild participating has the ability to name five commanders. Commanders have the ability to lead a group of NPCs, order them things, etc.
Each group is composed of a number of hired NPCs. Each of them occupies a different number of slots. For example, if the limit is 5 points, you could lead a group of 4 archers and one footsoldiers, or just a single dragon.

Using these NPCs abilities generates a special resource that can be used to cast Siege Abilities. For example, whenever you use a dragon's Fire Breath ability, it generates 24/500 of this resource. Casting the buff ability Rally requires 40...
Some units also generate that resource passively.
