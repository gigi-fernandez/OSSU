Tanking is centered around damage mitigation, helped by supports. Healing is scarce and health is hard to regain in dangerous settings (dungeons, sieges, etc).

1. Shield Mechanic:
   - Players have a regenerating shield for chip damage
   - Shield regeneration is temporarily disabled after receiving damage
   - Fast regeneration once it starts

2. Health System:
   - Health is divided into bars
   - Health does not regenerate naturally
   - Bars are recovered through overheal
   - Overheal accumulates towards recovering lost health bars
   - A threshold of overheal is required to recover a bar
   - Incoming damage prioritizes healing current health over bar recovery

3. Healing Mechanics:
   - Healing abilities have conditions or resources charged by combat actions
   - Healing resource is a 1:1 amount to health it can heal
   - Examples of charging healing power:
     - Empowering channel spell that charges healing by the same amount as the damage it increases
     - Dealing damage charges it by a certain percentage
     - Apply a buff to allies; if the ally performs a condition (e.g., receives or deals x amount of damage), the caster receives healing power

4. Tank Specifics:
   - Tanks have passives for partial shield regeneration
   - Active abilities to recover shield

5. Dangerous Zones:
   - Include dungeons, PvP areas, and surrounding regions
   - Restricted health regeneration
   - Food use limited to campfires
   - Solo play is extremely challenging

6. Campfire System:
   - Eating requires a campfire
   - Players cannot build campfires in dangerous zones
   - Pre-existing campfires act as healing stations in dangerous zones
   - Campfires are not mechanically safe zones
   - Visible from a distance (e.g., smoke signals)
   - Potential for different types of campfires with varying benefits

7. Food System:
   - Complex food system for health recovery
   - Primarily used in open world and safe zones
   - Limited effectiveness in dangerous zones due to campfire restriction
