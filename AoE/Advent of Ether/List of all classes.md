Warrior: Heavy melee DPS, from Barbarian archetype to Heavy armored Warlords. Can off-tank. Baseline they can use medium armor, but you can learn Heavy Armor Profficiency.

Knight: Heavy armored tanks with shield. From Dreadnaughts to Paladins. 

Scholar: Classic Wizards. Squishy ranged magic damage dealer. Probably has the most diversity of spells.

Rogue: light melee DPS. Utility, stealth, maybe some ranged attacks. Possibility of off tanking.

Witch: dark magic casters. Blood and Poison magic, necromancy, demonology, diseases, curses... Witches believe themselves above nature and feel they have the right to impose themselves on it.

Druid: nature magic, poisons, taming beasts, diseases, shapeshifting, healing. Can tank. Druids respect nature and vow to protect it. 

Priest: chooses a belief and follows it religiously, adapting their spells to it. Utility debuffs and healing. Very broad archetype.

Ranger: ranged physical damage dealer, survival, with some melee escape tools too. Can infuse arrows with magic. Can choose specializations that give you some baseline buffs and Profficiencies. For example: Archer Soldier: you have Profficiency in Heavy Armor and you have better Tactics.



Artisan: The non-combat class. Works a bit differently from the others as you have to choose your craft as the root of your talent tree, such as Cooking, Alchemy, Tinkering...


On top of these starter classes there might be some extra special classes if some ideas don't fit these archetypes.
