Nodes might have certain rules, depending on the predominant factions and some randomness. When guilds break those rules, they will create tension, up to the sabotage and then rebellion points.

For example, a node might be inhabited by religious people who revere the mountain sacred.

Certain actions are instant rebellions, like killing the leader of the node, or desecrating the sacred place.

Given that workers need to be transported to a node, local workers are much cheaper and safer to hire. If a node is under rebellion, workers might strike, causing delays and destruction. Guards get more expensive but can suppress rebellions.

If a rebellion wins, the node becomes neutral, controlled by no other guild. Neutral nodes are instantly repopulated with guards.

Sabotage is when a guild disrupts the node's functionality, like destroying a bridge, or flooding a warehouse. This causes destruction and inconvenience to the node's inhabitants, and it can be performed by any guild. Sabotage is costly and risky.
