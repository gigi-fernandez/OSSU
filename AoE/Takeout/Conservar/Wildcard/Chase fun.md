Don't look for a justification for anything beyond something superficial. Seek what's fun. Create minigames and encourage detours.
- Roguelike gamemode
- Arena shooter PvP (there are cards around that you can loot by going over them)
- Even battle royale
- Deck Draft PvP - Players draft cards from a shared pool to build their decks before battling each other. Losers pick first


Card proximity GOBs are spawned around the map. These make you draw a card of a certain type. They may also spawn as a condition of certain spells and passives. They may get looted by enemies in some ocassions(?)

Replace 95% of all "Draw a card" effect with spawn a card nearby. These card are drawn by the first person to touch them, represent a card from the caster's deck and are placed immediately in the player's hand. If a priest produces a card like this and a warrior picks it up, the warrior will get a priest ability from the priest's deck.
