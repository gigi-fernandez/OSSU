You have 6 cards in your hand which replace all of your abilities. These are your class abilities.
The cards are psuedo-randomly drawn from a deck you create beforehand. The deck js expanded by completing in-world activities and exploring.
You have 2 or 3 special cards that are always in your hand at the start of combat. They are abilities that modify your deck in some way. These are also obtained the same way and form part of your deck.
You have plenty of perks you can choose to customize your build. They can improve single cards, categories, be procs, add conditions, etc.

You gain a card on a period based on a stat (haste or whatever). Perks can also affect this.

You can choose how many (up to a limit) of a certain card you include in your deck. Each ability has a max amount. Consider spreading them as different drops in the world instead of gaining max from the start, i.e.: You can find Pyroblast in three different places, and each unique location adds up another use. Some basic abilities give you the max number of uses from the start.

Resource? Maybe something like Slay the Spire? 

Try GCD of 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5

There's the draw pile, the discard pile and the burn pile. You begin combat with all cards in the draw pile, and, based on the card and other synergies, they go into the discard pile or burn pile when you use them. The discard pile is shuffled into the draw pile when the latter one's empty, and the burn pile is removed until the end of combat.

Combat/out of combat timing needs to be refactored. When the enemy dies, combat ends, but OOC from when there aren't any actions taken or from distance should be relaxed.

All abilities can be used when OOC (they have CD) from the spellbook.

Classes all have different mechanics for rerolls, synergies, etc. 
All classes have a basic attack that is always available. Said attack is weaker than card abilities, but can be empowered by cards or used to regenerate other resources.

Abilities may add trash to an enemy deck that they may get rid off paying a price (take damage, debuff...)

Cards in hand may be permanent or temporary. Temporary cards expire on a timer if you don't use them, and go towards your burn pile when used.

Controls: custom keys for cards 1 to 6, with the option to assign other keys only for a given card when drawn. Alternative: radial menu with mouse when pressing a modifier.

Combat starts with 4 cards, while 6 is the maximum. However, you are also able to see the next two abilities you will draw at all times.

2 cards are drawn every 3 abilities (not cards!) used. This includes class abilities, basic attacks, 

(Optional) Once per combat you may reroll your entire hand, gaining a new card for every card you have in hand.

Players may obtain cards from any class, but they are not usable for them unless they switch class. However, they can destroy said cards in order to obtain Discovery tokens, which can be traded for information regarding the drop of their chosen card (more points for higher rarity cards) or, alternatively, pay multiple times said price to directly buy the chosen copy of that card. cards can't be traded with other players

Cards are not stored in the inventory, as they go directly towards the player's collection. There, each card collected is linked to a specific source (looted from Defias bandits, found in chest in Darrowfield, looted from Hogger...), and no more cards may be collected from said source. Whenever a card is destroyed, the source must be specified, and the player may now loot it again from there. Destroying cards is instant, and whenever you obtain a new card you are prompted with the option to destroy it if it's not from your class.

Card sources are personalized for each player, meaning that their locations can only be generally pointed at instead of being shareable between players. For example, a card can have the sources listed as: 
- Fire themed elite units. 
- Crooked Chest in Ghostlands
But the specific location is unique for each player (based on GUID). One may find it from Fire elementals in molten core, while another from a Dragon in UBRS. Thus the importance of Discovery tokens, as they can give you the specific information for your character.
If a character ever sources a card, the accurate source will be registered on their collection forever, even if destroyed. That way, they can go back another time if they feel like using it this time around.

Being close (65yds) to certain sources of cards (like gameobjects) gives a certain visual and sound cue (screen lightens up a little and a hum plays).


Beyond the mechanic:
- Consider reducing the amount of regular enemies by 50/67%. Focus on creating longer, less frequent encounters.
- Playtest in Eversong Forest and add cards all around it until level 20.
- Eliminate level's effect in combat. Higher levels only impact what you can incorporate in your deck and the difficulty of enemies.
