Blind: Doesn't let the player see which cards are which (they are reversed).
Hex: Cards used are burned instead of discarded.
Encumbered: Cards used are substituted by Encumbered after going into the discard pile. Encumbered is a card that does nothing, but you need to use it to burn it, thus wasting a GCD.
Shocked: Using cards deals damage to the user.
