Warriors get extra benefit of duplicate cards. Whenever they have a duplicate card in hand, the ability impacts twice, or has duration doubled or has value doubled, whatever is most impactful, burning a copy and discarding the other one.

Mages are able to see the whole draw pile and reshuffle at will under a CD. Whenever they open their deck, they are unable to use any other ability, and must decide whether to reshuffle then and there or wait for the next CD. They essentially need to decide on a quick look.

Warlocks can activate Immolation Pact, burning all the following defensive cards used until OOC. Also, passively, burning cards heals them for a percentage of their health.
Warlocks could start with a summon card, which is a small cast, so that they can use pet abilities


Rogues can steal cards from both piles on a short CD, but stolen cards get burned when used.

Priest cards leave a copy of the opposite discipline (shadow cards leave a light card, and viceversa). This copy is burned on use.

Shaman totem cards leave a totem of said element on that position. Whenever you use a card in that position of the same element as the totem, it is greatly enhanced, but the totem is removed from the card slot.

Hunters also have pet cards in their deck. Hunter cards may be marked by their pet, making the pet perform a bonus action.
- Damage cards: Pet attacks for extra damage
- Utility cards: Draw the next two pet cards.
- Defensive cards: Pet charges towards you, shields you, gains 80% increased speed and goes back to attack the target.

Paladins can send supportive cards to allies' hands. Also, they heal themselves and an ally a small amount whenever they use a card. 
Paladins also have Divine Favor, a passive that makes paladins much more likely to roll favorable cards. When the target is an enemy and the paladin is healthy, damage and offensive utility. When the paladin or the ally target are injured, healing and defensive utility. However, this means that the draw forecast (the two following cards to be drawn) is subject to change all the time.


Druid will be WIP for a while. Shapeshifting hard.
