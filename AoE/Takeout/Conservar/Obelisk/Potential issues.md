If it needs people to go into government buildings, there's two options:

1. I just try to sell this as enterprise software to consulting companies.
2. I build the company up, hire people to do the least amount of work under minimum wage (hell, I could even turn into a gig app somehow. well, maybe not). Best case scenario, it adds a big barrier from competition. They could even do it in batches

If it needs licensed people, I would sell this as enterprise software for notarios.
