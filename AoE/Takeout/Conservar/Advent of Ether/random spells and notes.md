LEAPs:
BASE POINTS: HEIGHT
MISC A: REACH

Unstopable Force (Passive Trick): Reduces your movement speed by 10%, but you cannot be slowed below 70% of your normal speed.

Chronostab: Deals melee thrust damage to your target and steals 25% of their movement speed for 3 seconds.

Unnatural Reflexes: Increases your chance to dodge by 5% and allows you to dodge, parry and block from behind.

Roll/Dash: Roll forward in a straight line. 
	I could use Force Forward Movement and make an invisible frame that disables all keyboard inputs for the duration of the spell.

Trinket, Trick, Spell or Virtue: Variant of Titan's grip that allows you to wield a 2H weapon and an off-hand/dagger simultaneously.

For constant damage skillshots use Spell Effect 129, and for helpful ones use 128. Take 28531 for example

119: APPLY AREA AURA PET. Good for player-pet auras. I think the player casts that and only their pets receive it.

Mirror Image: Summon a clone after 0.1 seconds invisibility that attempts to mirror your actions. (you can use 93: Force Deselect)

SE 79: Might drop combat??

81 - CREATE_HOUSE: if used with target AoE destination, the model displayed for the spell is that of the model you place (a chair, a table, etc)
