Always keep in time that downtime is not fun. Use it wisely, as a palate cleanser, as punishment (sometimes), but do not drag things unnecessarily. Some suggestions:

- Reduce the amount of trash in a dungeon, 
- After a wipe, respawn everyone close to the action.
- Make most buffs persist on death. Extend duration of player buffs inside a dungeon/raid/siege.
- Make rotations not as complex. Keep additional spells for utility or edge cases. With talents, replace instead of adding (most of the time). Ex: Shield Slam as a tank replacement for Slam. Do not have abilities on your spellbook that are not used.
