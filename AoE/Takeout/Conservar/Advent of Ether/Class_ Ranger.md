Abilities: 
- Preferred Prey: While on a Resting Area, you can select a creature type as your Prey. This increases your damage against them and allows you to track them. Does not work against rare units.
- Developed Smell: Allows you to smell rare enemies, sensing how near they are and in which direction. You will identify the smell, but you will need to discover to which creature it belongs to. You will be displayed a few colored textures, partially layered on top of each other, and you will need to check out the source to know which mob it is. The colors and textures are based on Tags. Tags are given based on smell to all rares (Musky, Fiery, Rotten, Sulphurous...)
- Stalk: While targetting your Preferred Prey, you enter an improved Stealth, in which you can move and gain increased damage on your first ability after or before exiting stealth.
