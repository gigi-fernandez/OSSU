Should I simplify the number of abilities? Something like 6 to 8 active abilities, while adding a lot of customization and replacements for them. Say, the class has ability slots that have different available spells, like CC, mobility, defensive, offensive, buff, etc. they can have multiple options of those (one slot can be CC or DPS).

Thing is, players can multiclass. How is that reconciled with this limited set of abilities? They can choose from all of their known abilities. What about which slots? 


Also, I want players to have roleplaying abilities, non-combat skills, very situational abilities, but without cluttering their ability set in combat. What should I do? Have two ability pyramids, one for combat skills and another one for roleplaying skills.
