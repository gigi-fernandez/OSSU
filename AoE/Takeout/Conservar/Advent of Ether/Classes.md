Reconsider classless. Instead players invest levels in classes loke in BG3. Classes have a huge variety of abilities that can be learned from different disciplines. Skill trees have slots for learning a type of ability (say, spammable damage) from the list of all abilities you have discovered for that class.

If you have 10 levels in paladin and want to try warrior, you will have level 10 pally and lvl 1 warrior.

Talent points can be earned in a cycical way (1p, 2p, 3p, repeat).

Some nodes in the talent tree are Feats, shared passives or actives for all classes. Broad list, same for all levels.
