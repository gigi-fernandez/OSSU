Some cooking recipes require a ritual to be completed. These rituals make the food more exclusive, while helping reflect a culture's tradition.

Ex: Almohada has a cooking ritual for Moonbathed Lamb. This requires you to cover a lamb with spices, wrap it in linen and bury it under a full moon. You must wait 12h until you can dig it up. This lamb yields delicious grade food for many people.
