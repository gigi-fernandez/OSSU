Cooking should feel like combat, to an extent. Players have abilities for controlling heat, cutting ingredients, putting things in a pan/pot, removing them, etc. Ingredients have a duration, and the longer the duration is by the time they are put in the pan/pot, the higher the quality of the meal. Some dishes are relaxing to cook, while others should feel stressful.

Cooking should have "boss fights". Dishes that are so convoluted they may need multiple cooks preparing it at the same time for optimal quality (if quality is below a certain threshold, the dish becomes a standard version, with reduced stats).
Cooking is a viable way of progressing your character. There are quests for delivering a quality meal to a certain NPC that give good rewards. There are also competitive events where you must compete with other cooks to make the highest quality meal for an NPC for great rewards.

Abilities:
- Heat Barrage: Channeled ability that produces fire in a straight line in front of you (or cone, depending in vfx available) periodically, dealing damage to enemies and heating up pots, pans, ovens and grills by 1 every 1 second. Goes up to 10 heat.
- Control Heat: Self-Cast Aura that reduces the amount of Heat increased by Heat Barrage and the amount of Heat decreased by Chill to 2.
- (Middle of the Cooking tree) Chill: Basically the opposite of Heat Barrage, but it can go up to -10. Also slows enemies, but deals less damage. Unlocks Frozen storage and Cold Cuisine.
- (passive) Frozen Storage: If you make an ingredient reach -10 Heat, it will become Frozen, freezing its duration for 30 minutes (can be reapplied to keep it like this indefinitely), but applying Thawed when heated up again. Some ingredients will decrease in quality when Thawed.
- Slice: Channeled ability that produces cuts in front of you, dealing 10% weapon damage to enemies and slicing ingredients.

Branches: 
- Field Cook: Improved ability to improvise meals from just-gathered ingredients. Gives you better portable Utensils.
- Restaurateur: Specializes in complex cooking which may require more utensils and an expansive kitchen station.
