Priests gain their power through devotion to a deity or pantheon. 
They perform rituals to prove their faith (the specifics vary depending on the faith). 
Whenever they aid a target or damage/debuff an enemy, they leave a mark of their Deity on them, periodically having a small chance of being helped by their Deity. 
- Ex: When you heal a target, they become blessed for a few seconds. Every second, there is a small chance of something happening. For ex: If the target is below 25%, for example, they may be healed for quite a bit, on a CD. The effect of these Divine Aid is influenced by the Priest's chosen skills. In the case of it being an enemy, the opposite applies. A small chance of something happening to them. This effect stacks, and thus becomes more likely to proc, the more the Priest abilities impact the target.

Most of a Priest spells have a low CD and duration to encourage stacking Divine Odds on their targets.
There is another category for priest spells called Miracles. Miracles spend a Priest's Faith resource to trigger some very impactful effects. Ex: Divine Shield, without its debuff, could be considered a Miracle. 

Faith is a resource they must gain through unique means of pleasin their deity. Ex: Metkons worship crafting practical and beautiful things, so if you are a Metkon priest you must craft such objects to gain Faith (and a good chunk of EXP too!). If they are a Demonic Worshipper they must summon demons into the world. If their faith demands pilgrimage, then pilgrimage grants Faith...
Faith has a small cap (about 10) and can be used for minor and major miracles. Faith generation rituals have a daily CD or cap too. Usage of Miracles should feel impactful and strategic. Priests should want to use them, as Faith rituals are a good source of EXP.

When a Priest can no longer gain EXP, rituals have a chance to grant them certain divine items, used mainly for crafting.
