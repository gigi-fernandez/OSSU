You can punch/bat the bouncy ball

Ability that makes the ball bounce for longer, go through enemies and keep the speed.

Ability to slow down time from time to time to align your bounces

Spawn a column on where your camera is looking (can put it below you just like Mei's Ice Wall from OW or use it to create another bounce surface)
