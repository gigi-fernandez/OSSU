A player should have only one ball at a time (maybe different types in the future). Said ball has a 4s CD, but if you catch it (go near its vecinity) you refresh it.

Damage is based upon speed. If it starts to lose speed it will decrease in damage. The ball maintains its speed if it keeps bouncing and increases its damage and knockback by 25% with each bounce (up to 3). Direct impacts do nothing at all, 1 bounce is low, 2 bounces is standard and 3 bounces is a critical. The VFX should reflect when bouncing against surfaces and on impact. If the bounces occur over the same surface, it only counts as one bounce.

The ball should have a certain glow and UI indicators that make it easy to pinpoint.
