Creature templates, Display IDs, models, etc, are tagged based on their theme. 
For example, a Ghoul would be categorized as "Scourge". So, when creating the creatures for an undead-themed Shard, you would choose up to 5 themes with an adjusted proportion for each, scourge being the main one in this case. It could look like this:

Theme proportion:
- Scourge (70%)
- Worm (5%)
- Legion (15%)
- Undead Beast (10%)

These do not account for critters. 
For each 5% a theme has, it adds another type of creature. Scourge would have 14 different types of creatures, Worm 1, Legion 3 and Undead Beast 2. Also, the number of creatures scattered throughout the map would follow the same proportion.

Same deal with M2 and WMO models (they have other tags on top of theme, like "Big Building", "Tree", etc). For example, if the Shard is Scourge themed, Tree models would be selected randomly from all tree models with the tag "Scourge". Same deal with ground textures.
