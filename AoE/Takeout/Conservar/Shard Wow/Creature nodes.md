Creatures spawn near their nodes, not randomly. 
The nodes are placed throughout the map randomly (unless specified otherwise) using a system that prevents them from being too close from the other. 

Nodes are just dummy NPCs. Creatures are then spawned at a random distance of 50 yards from them (again, without cluttering). 
Each node spawns a number based on the density and radius input, with a default of 50% density and 30 yd radius, but these can be modified to whatever value (a slider with input box).
